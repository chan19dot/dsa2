//Tomorrow Peter has a Biology exam. He does not like this subject much,
// but d days ago he learnt that he would have to take this exam.
// Peter's strict parents made him prepare for the exam immediately,
// for this purpose he has to study not less than minTimei and not more than maxTimei hours per
// each i-th day. Moreover, they warned Peter that a day before the exam they would check how he has followed their instructions.
//
//So, today is the day when Peter's parents ask him to show the timetable of his preparatory studies.
// But the boy has counted only the sum of hours sumTime spent him on preparation, and now he wants to know if
// he can show his parents a timetable sсhedule with d numbers, where each number sсhedulei stands for the time in hours spent by
// Peter each i-th day on biology studies, and satisfying the limitations imposed by his parents, and at the same time the sum total of all
// schedule i should equal to sumTime.
